This is an opinionated post. Consider yourself warned. You will probably disagree with at least some of it, and that is completely fine. The important part is the thought process – don’t just read through it and agree or disagree, think about what you agree or disagree with and why. Becoming aware of these things is valuable: once you become aware of why you dislike something, you can start doing something about it.
