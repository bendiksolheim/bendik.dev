Min gode venn gjennom mange år. Jeg skal være ærlig: forholdet vårt starta litt turbulent. Jeg var usikker på om det å blande HTML inn i Javascripten egentlig var noen god idé. Det tok faktisk et par år før du klarte å overbevise meg! Men du var heldigvis tålmodig. For det som starta som en skepsis viste seg å etter hvert til å bli til en aldri så liten forelskelse! Ohh boy!</section><section><h2><a href=https://www.bendik.dev/posts/honest-functions/>(Dis)Honest Functions</a></h2><span>March 3, 2021 – 8 minute read time</span><p>After a recent debugging session, discovering I had once again been the victim of a dishonest function signature, I was... Well, let’s just say I was unimpressed. Two thoughts popped up in my head – the first one was «ahh.. this thing again..», and the second was «wait, why is this still even a thing?». It left me in a state of frustration.</section><section><h2><a href=https://www.bendik.dev/posts/java-version-management-on-macos/>Java Version Management on macOS</a></h2><span>January 30, 2021 – 5 minute read time</span><p>With the increased frequency of Java releases handling multiple versions on a single machine is more and more relevant.

Consider yourself warned. You will probably disagree with at least some of it, and that is completely fine.
